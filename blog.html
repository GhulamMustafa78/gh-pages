    <p size="5em"> <i> Adventure Photog is a great example to check out when you're first approaching the question of
            how to start a blog. The blog design mirrors its content and posts provide detailed guidance about specific
            hikes, as well as useful information about activities such as canyoneering and activities for kids. From the
            written content within, it’s clear that Arika, the creator of this adventure photography website, is
            in-the-know about her field.


            Other features also make this evident. One of those is the rugged, playful atmosphere of the blog, which
            uses a green and yellow color scheme to evoke ideas of nature and sunshine. The blog’s homepage is rich with
            images of happy clients enjoying their adventures - visual testimonials that confirm Arika’s skill as a
            photographer. She further encourages engagement by embedding her Instagram Feed directly onto her site,
            spreading the word about her service and drawing people deeper into her brand.
